## 📝 Course Review: Wolfram U – Cryptography

The "Introduction to Cryptography" course from Wolfram U provides a structured and hands-on overview of essential cryptographic concepts using **Wolfram Language notebooks**.

✅ What I Liked

- Strong mathematical intuition with step-by-step visual examples  
- Great for people with interest in both **theory** and **practical modeling**
- Executable demos help reinforce concepts interactively
- Excellent integration with real cryptographic operations (RSA, Hashing, Signing)

📌 What Could Be Improved

- Could include more attack examples (e.g., padding oracle, side-channel)
- More real-world context around implementation risks

---

## 🎓 Final Thoughts

This is a solid course for anyone looking to:

- Understand the **mathematics behind cryptography**
- Get hands-on with Wolfram Language
- Bridge theory and demo in a **self-paced** manner

💡 Recommended for: Computer science students, cryptography beginners, or Mathematica users exploring applied security.

---

## 📌 Notes

- All notebooks were created and tested in **Wolfram Mathematica Desktop**  
- Course provider: [Wolfram U](https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-u/)
- Tools used: Wolfram Language, modular arithmetic, asymmetric encryption, hashing
