# Classical Ciphers

Classical ciphers are historical encryption techniques used before the advent of modern computers. Though insecure by today’s standards, they laid the foundation for modern cryptography.

## Caesar Cipher
- Shift each letter by a fixed amount.
- Vulnerable to brute-force and frequency analysis.
  
## Substitution Cipher
- Each letter is substituted with another letter based on a fixed mapping.
- Security depends on secrecy of the mapping.
- Easily broken with frequency analysis.

## Vigenère Cipher
- Polyalphabetic cipher using a keyword to determine shifts.
- More secure than Caesar but still vulnerable to Kasiski examination and frequency analysis.

## Playfair Cipher
- Encrypts pairs of letters using a 5x5 grid.
- More complex than simple substitution.

## Hill Cipher
- Uses linear algebra (matrix multiplication) for encryption.
- Broken with known-plaintext attacks.

## Takeaways
- Classical ciphers are useful for learning, not for real-world use.
