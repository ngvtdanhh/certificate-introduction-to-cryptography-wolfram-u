# Public-Key Cryptography

Also called **asymmetric cryptography**, it uses a **pair of keys**: public and private.

## Key Concepts
- **Public key**: Shared openly.
- **Private key**: Kept secret.
- Anyone can encrypt, only the private key holder can decrypt.

## RSA
- Based on factoring large integers.
- Widely used for encryption and digital signatures.

## Diffieâ€“Hellman
- Key exchange protocol using modular exponentiation.
- Securely establishes a shared secret.

## ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)
- Smaller key sizes, faster operations.
- Used in modern mobile and IoT applications.

## Applications
- SSL/TLS for HTTPS.
- Secure email (e.g., PGP).
- Cryptocurrency wallets.

## Takeaways
- Solves the key distribution problem of symmetric crypto.
